**BATTERY LIMIT:**

**11.6V**

> I assume that you can charge the batteries through the engine. In other words, use the alternator aka dynamo on the engine. I never ran the engine just to top up the batteries, so cannot advice on it much. Something prudent would be to measure the current on the alternator to see how much is produced.
