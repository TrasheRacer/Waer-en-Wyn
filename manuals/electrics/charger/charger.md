# Placement

Charger needs to be in a dry and well ventilated area (as it is actively 
cooled), properly bolted screwed in so what no wave can rip your 3.8kg 
charger off the wall... so nice screws might also be worth sth - as I 
don't know if they came with charger or not.

The charger has voltage sense - for that we need 0.75mm^2 cable and a 
5AT fuse - if you want it, that's optional.

# Outstanding items

In order of rarity:

- Crimping tool (marina, other marinas, car garages) – Hornbach, Praxis, Gamma does not have it. :(
- Eyes (need measurement)
- Nuts & bolts

## 230V input

So did any cables come with your charger? maybe you also need a cable 
for you 230V input?

- [x] monitor cable ← LAG

## Tools

- [x] Blankets to cover the solar panels while working and prob. disconnecting the whole electrical system!
- [ ] Wrenches for battery connectors (have a few sized, not sure what size we need).
- [x] Screwdriver and bits to open up charger, clamp cables, screw charger to wall, fuses, leak current protector, etc.
- [x] Electric drill
- [ ] Crimping the eyes onto the cables needs a special tool though (also cutting 25mm^2 of copper), not sure that's available at the harbour?

  - DONE: call harbour

Crimping and cutting tongue for large cables (at harbour) - or prefabbed cables (if prefabbed: at boatshops, or carshops - the cheapest would prob. be a proper starter cable set (some have eyes inside the clamps - but depends on models, considering time constraint, I'd go with what the shops have).
